    <p>The University Center is located on the top floor of the College Nine/John R. Lewis Dining Hall Commons. College Nine and John R. Lewis College are located off of McLaughlin Drive, across from the Cowell Health Center.</p>

    <p><strong>By foot or bus:&nbsp;</strong>Those walking or arriving by Metro bus should use the College 9/John R. Lewis bus stop.</p>

    <p><strong>Parking:&nbsp;</strong>For those driving, there are several parking options, but please keep in mind that nearby parking is extremely limited; you may find it easier to park in either the Core West Parking Structure or the East Remote lot and take a campus shuttle.&nbsp;There is parking available in small lots along the John R. Lewis College service road. There is also a small lot across McLaughlin Drive at the Cowell Health Center; eight metered spaces are available there. During the week, “A” and “B” permits are required in these lots. The parking structure has 19 Pay Station spaces available to guests and short-term parkers, for up to two hours. When parking in these spaces, payment is made with cash or credit card to the pay station located next to the elevator on the second level of the structure.&nbsp;The closest accessible parking spaces are just north of the University Center on the College Nine service road; there are several more just off the John R. Lewis College service road.</p>

    <p>Parking permits are required in most lots on weekdays between 7:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. Lot designations are subject to change; it is advisable to check the permit requirements posted at parking lot entrances when parking on campus.</p>

    <p>One-day visitor permits may be purchased at the main entrance Kiosk, or at the TAPS Sales Office located in the H Barn at the base of campus. Parking meters are posted regarding hours of enforcement.</p>
