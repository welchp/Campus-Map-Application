    <p>The Baobab Lounge is located in Merrill College, in the northeast corner of the campus core.</p>

    <p><b>By foot or bus:</b> Take the steep path heading northeast from the Crown/Merrill bus stop.</p>

    <p><b>By car:</b> For those driving from the Main Entrance, stay on Coolidge Drive. Shortly after Coolidge turns left and becomes McLaughlin Drive, turn right at the sign for Merrill College. At the top of the hill, veer right.</p>

    <p><b>Parking:</b> There are metered parking spaces along the left side of the lot, and parking for “A,” “B,” and “C” permits along the right. There are two accessible parking spaces if you turn left at the top of the hill. If they are full, make a loop of the main parking lot, and you will find a third accessible space on the left-hand side as you complete the loop.</p>

    <p>Parking permits are required in most lots on weekdays between 7:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. Lot designations are subject to change; it is advisable to check the permit requirements posted at parking lot entrances when parking on campus. Parking meters are posted regarding hours of enforcement.</p>

    <p>One-day visitor permits may be purchased at the main entrance Kiosk, or at the TAPS Sales Office located in the H Barn at the base of campus.</p>
