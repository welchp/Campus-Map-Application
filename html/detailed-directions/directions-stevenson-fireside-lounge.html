    <p>The Wagstaff Fireside Lounge is located in Stevenson College, in the southeast corner of the campus core.</p>

    <p><strong>By foot or bus:&nbsp;</strong>Those walking or arriving by Metro bus or campus shuttle can take the Crown/Merrill bus stop.</p>

    <p><strong>By car:&nbsp;</strong>For those driving from the Main Entrance, stay on Coolidge Drive. Shortly after Coolidge turns left and becomes McLaughlin Drive, turn left at the first opportunity, following the sign for Stevenson College.</p>

    <p><strong>Parking:&nbsp;</strong>As soon as you turn off of McLaughlin, you will find parking lots on either side of the service road. The lot on the left has metered parking. Both lots allow “A,” “B,” and “C” permit holders. If this lot is full, continue along the service road as it goes uphill. There are several additional meters along the right side.&nbsp;Those needing accessible parking spaces will find them adjacent to the metered parking along the service road.</p>

    <p>Parking permits are required in most lots on weekdays between 7:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. Lot designations are subject to change; it is advisable to check the permit requirements posted at parking lot entrances when parking on campus.</p>

    <p>One-day visitor permits may be purchased at the main entrance Kiosk, or at the TAPS Sales Office located in the H Barn at the base of campus. Parking meters are posted regarding hours of enforcement.</p>
