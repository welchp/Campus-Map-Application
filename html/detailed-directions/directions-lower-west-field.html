    <p>The Lower West Field is used for graduation ceremonies, and is located east of Heller Drive. It is best accessed from the West Entrance of the campus.</p>

    <p><strong>By car:&nbsp;</strong>At the Main Entrance, proceed west on Empire Grade, then turn right on Heller (the West Entrance). Turn right at the first opportunity to park in the West Perimeter Parking Lot.</p>

    <p><strong>Parking:&nbsp;</strong>There are two accessible parking places at the east end of the lot, closest to the field. Please be aware that there is a significant slope between those two spaces and the field itself.&nbsp;If you or someone in your party needs closer access due to disability-related needs, please have the graduate contact his or her college activities office to arrange this ahead of time.</p>

    <p>Parking permits are required in most lots on weekdays between 7:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. Lot designations are subject to change; it is advisable to check the permit requirements posted at parking lot entrances when parking on campus.</p>

    <p>One-day visitor permits may be purchased at the main entrance Kiosk, or at the TAPS Sales Office located in the H Barn at the base of campus. Parking meters are posted regarding hours of enforcement.</p>
