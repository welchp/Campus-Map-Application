    <p>The College Nine/Ten Multi-Purpose Room is located on the ground floor of the University Center building, which is north of McLaughlin Drive, across from the Cowell Health Center.</p>

    <p><strong>By foot or bus:&nbsp;</strong>Those walking or arriving by Metro bus or campus shuttle can follow the wheelchair-accessible path from the Colleges Nine/Ten bus stop.</p>

    <p><strong>Parking:&nbsp;</strong>For those driving, there are several parking options, but please keep in mind that nearby parking is extremely limited; you may find it easier to park in either the Core West Parking Structure or the East Remote lot and take a campus shuttle.&nbsp;There is parking available in small lots along the College Ten service road. During the week, “A” and “B” permits are required in these lots. The Core West Parking Structure has 19 pay station spaces available to guests and short-term parkers, for up to two hours. When parking in these spaces, payment is made with cash or credit card at the pay station (next to the elevator on the second level).&nbsp;The closest accessible parking space is at the University Center loading dock. Other accessible spaces are just north of the University Center on the College Nine service road, and there are several more just off the College Ten service road.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Parking permits are required in most lots on weekdays between 7:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. Lot designations are subject to change; it is advisable to check the permit requirements posted at parking lot entrances when parking on campus.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>One-day visitor permits may be purchased at the main entrance Kiosk, or at the TAPS Sales Office located in the H Barn at the base of campus. Parking meters are posted regarding hours of enforcement.</p>
