    <p>The Quarry Amphitheater is located just north of the Quarry Plaza, near the intersection of Hagar and McLaughlin Drives.</p>

    <p><strong>By foot or bus:&nbsp;</strong>Those walking or arriving by Metro bus or campus shuttle can walk through the Plaza and take the stairs leading to the top of the amphitheater.</p>

    <p><strong>Parking:&nbsp;</strong>For those driving, there are three parking options, listed in order of proximity to the Quarry Amphitheater: the Hahn Student Services parking lot, the East Field House parking lot, and the East Remote parking lot. The Hahn Student Services parking lot has 21 metered parking spaces; an “A” permit is required for all other spaces in this lot. The East Field House lot has 36 metered parking spaces; other spaces require an “A” or “B” permit. The East Remote parking lot requires “A,” “B,” “C,” or “R” permits.&nbsp;There is one accessible parking space behind the Student Union/Redwood Building, and a wheelchair-accessible path leading from that space to the amphitheater.</p>

    <p>For special events, such as graduation ceremonies, the Quarry Plaza parking area is usually reserved for those with accessibility- related parking needs. A wheelchair lift-equipped van will then shuttle those needing wheelchair access to the accessible path.</p>

    <p>Parking permits are required in most lots on weekdays between 7:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. Lot designations are subject to change; it is advisable to check the permit requirements posted at parking lot entrances when parking on campus.</p>

    <p>One-day visitor permits may be purchased at the main entrance Kiosk, or at the TAPS Sales Office located in the H Barn at the base of campus. Parking meters are posted regarding hours of enforcement.</p>
