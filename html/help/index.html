                This web mapping application has undergone some changes behind the scenes in recent months. The map is prettier. The icons are more customized. And there are some extra features to make your experience more enjoyable.

                This web mapping application was previously managed by ITS and TAPS staff through a Drupal CMS and is now managed by Physical Planning, Development & Operations (PPDO) staff through a combination of locally developed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and remotely hosted data accessed via the ArcGIS JavaScript API.<br><br>
                Code will eventually be made available via GitHub. When it is, feel free to fork it and develop your own modifications!

                This section is located towards the upper right corner of the web map. It behaves as more of an auto-complete rather than a similarity search.

                When finding features, it is important to consider whether the features are <strong>named</strong> or <strong>unnamed</strong>. Understanding that distinction will indicate how to best find that feature.<br><br>               
                Here are some examples of both named and unnamed features.
